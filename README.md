# Silent Failure of Firebase's update() method

This code demonstrates a silent failure in Firebase's `update()` method when attempting to update a document that doesn't exist.  The `catch` block executes only for errors during the update operation itself; no error is caught if the document is missing. This makes debugging harder.

**Problem:** The `update()` method doesn't explicitly signal failure when the document to update is not found.  It simply doesn't update anything. This lack of feedback makes detecting errors and properly handling missing documents more challenging.

**Solution:** The provided solution adds a `get()` operation before the `update()` call to explicitly check for the document's existence before attempting to update it. This ensures a more robust and predictable behavior, allowing for better error handling and debugging.
